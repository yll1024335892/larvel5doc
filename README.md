## Introduction

A quick reference guide (cheat sheet) for Laravel 5.1 LTS, listing artisan, composer, routes and other useful bits of information.

We intend to build this Cheat Sheet more assessable and user friendly, you can view it with modern desktop :computer: browser and mobile device :iphone: .


### Only support for Laravel 5.1 LTS

Pull Request is welcome, but because Laravel 5.1 is long time support version, so we wouldn't support other version until 2018, we appreciate your understanding :)

YES, we love LTS :sparkles:  :sparkles:  :sparkles:
